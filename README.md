you a have a menu that take you to different windows such as -

* Welcome - home page, you can find here 2 button. 
first, sign-up btn: sign-up button, if you haven't signed up, now it's a good time :) 
second, log-in btn: that take you to set settings for the game.
* Setting - you can set your setting by :
1. choose your in-game keyboard (press on each arrow and then select a key),
2. Then you will have to choose the number and colors of pacman's food. 
3. And after all you have to choose the game time and number of monsters you want to deal with (Note!- greater number of monsters -> difficulty level rising)
For easier life, you can press the Random button that select the settings for you.
Don't forget to press on - Start in order to start the game.
* Log-In & Sign-Up 
* About - a little bit of information about the code&design and the difficults we faced.

To make the game a little more interesting you can find the following functionality -

We hope you will enjoy at least as much as we enjoyed doing it :)
